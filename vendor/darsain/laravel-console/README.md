# Laravel 4 Console

In-browser console for Laravel 4 PHP framework.

This bundle executes your code within `ConsoleController@postExecute` context, and displays the produced output.

The purpose is to easily test your stuff without creating garbage routes and controllers just to run something, ...
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about :)

This bundle is intended for a local testing, and **shouldn't get nowhere near your production servers!**
